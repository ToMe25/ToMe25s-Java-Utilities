# ToMe25s-Java-Utilities
A collection of common Utilities i use in a lot of Projects, moved into a library to simplify keeping them up to date everywhere.

This Library Currently contains:
 * A simple Json Handler
 * A simple Config Handler
 * A Print Stream That can write to multiple Output Streams
 * A Print Stream That can write to multiple Output Streams and has some logging/tracing capabilities

To add the git-hooks to your active git hooks(at least on Linux as they are Shell Scripts and wont work on Windows) just execute the post-merge file in git-hooks.

In case you are looking for a build: the ToMe25-Java-Utilities.jar file gets build automatically on commit, so it should always be up to date.
